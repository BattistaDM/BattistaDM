### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm studying **Economics and Business Law** at [UniCatt](https://www.unicatt.it/) with a focus on **international markets**. My academic background in market structures and regulations, combined with my passion for **quantitative finance**, drives me to build computational solutions for complex financial problems.

I'm particularly interested in **algorithmic trading strategies** and **high-frequency trading** implementations. When I'm not coding or studying markets, you'll find me at the **gym** - I believe in maintaining a balanced life between intellectual pursuits and physical wellness.

**Currently exploring:** Machine learning applications in portfolio optimization and market prediction, and the intersection of regulatory frameworks with trading algorithms.

### 💡 Fun Fact

*"I believe the best quantitative analysts understand not just the math behind the models, but also the economic forces and regulatory frameworks that drive market behavior. Oh, and that a strong body supports a strong mind - hence my love for the gym!"*
